##ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, Iâ€™m Christ John Mercurio! :coffee:
- ðŸ‘€ I am a software developer with a keen interest in building web applications. I enjoy spending my free time watching anime, movie series, and playing video games. I also believe in the importance of getting enough sleep to be productive throughout the day.

- :bulb: What I'm currently learning:
I am currently learning NestJS Framework to enhance my skills in building scalable and maintainable server-side applications.

- :fire: My goal:
My goal is to become a Full Stack Web Developer, and I am working towards achieving this by constantly improving my skills and learning new technologies.
